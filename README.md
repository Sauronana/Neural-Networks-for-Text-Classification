### Update on 1st May, 2019:
Please note that Senator Michael Bennet has unexpectedly deleted his Twitter account recently in this week. This might cause a problem when reader tries to re-run my 4th code chunk where I scrape all the data. Please remove this senator from the dataframe named as "df" if needed. If similar scenarios occur, please follow the same instruction. 

# Reader Instructions:

* The additional file is a table containing 80 senators' Twitter usernames and their political party, which is used as a small part of the data in the report. This particular table was scraped from https://www.socialseer.com/resources/us-senator-twitter-accounts/ via Excel.
